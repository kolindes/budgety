# Budgety flask backend Project

This project is a budget management and transaction handling application built using Python, Flask, and SQLAlchemy.

## Installation

1. Create a Python virtual environment using the following command:
```commandline
python -m venv venv
```

2. Install the required dependencies using the following command:
```commandline
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the application using Flask, use the following command:
```commandline
flask run
```

This will start the Flask development server and the application will be available at `http://localhost:5000/`.

You can also specify a specific host and port to use with the `--host` and `--port` options. For example:
```commandline
flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8000
```

This will start the server on all network interfaces and listen on port 8000.
